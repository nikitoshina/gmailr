<p>This article explains how to create your own OAuth client and how to
configure it for use with gmailr.</p>
<p>This article contains many screenshots, by necessity. However, there
are many downsides to a screenshot-heavy article and the reader needs to
be ready to adapt to certain issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>These webpages are outside of the control of gmailr and change over
time.</li>
<li>These webpages can look different depending on:
<ul>
<li>The type of Google account you are using, i.e. an individual versus
a user within a Google workspace organization, such as a company or
university.</li>
<li>Your previous use of Google Cloud.</li>
<li>Probably other factors!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is that the screenshots you see here may not exactly
match what you see. We offer this assistance on a “best effort” basis,
but you may need to be a bit resourceful and resilient. There may be
differences between the screenshots here and what you see.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="overview">Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview"></a>
</h2>
<p>This is a multi-step process and it’s easy to get lost in the weeds,
so here is an overview. I include some detail here, so that someone
who’s done this before might be able to work from just this
checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to Google Cloud console <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/" class="external-link uri">https://console.cloud.google.com/</a>.</li>
<li>Create a Google Cloud project. And/or select the target
project.</li>
<li>Enable the Gmail API for the project.</li>
<li>Configure the OAuth consent screen for the project (or, using
Google’s vocabulary, for your “app”):
<ul>
<li>Specify the user type, i.e. external vs. internal. An individual
Google user, operating outside of Google Workspace, must choose
external. Inside an organization, it is possible to choose internal and
that is a good idea.</li>
<li>Select the allowed scopes. Below I recommend a few nonsensitive
default scopes, plus the Gmail-related scopes.</li>
<li>List the allowed users. This applies to a project with external user
type and “Testing” publishing status (as opposed to “In
production”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create an OAuth client and download a JSON representation of it.
<ul>
<li>Here you must choose between the “Desktop app” or “Web” client type.
We cover how to make this decision below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell gmailr about your OAuth client.
<ul>
<li>Put the downloaded JSON in the place where gmailr can discover it or
provide the filepath via an environment variable or provide it directly
in <code>gm_auth_configure(path =)</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="sign-in-to-google-cloud-console">Sign in to Google Cloud console<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sign-in-to-google-cloud-console"></a>
</h2>
<p><em>I focus on the user who has never used Google Cloud before and
who is authenticating as an individual (versus as a user within an
organization). The rationale is that these are the users who will
benefit the most from this detailed documentation. I may eventually
create documentation focused on a different type of user, but, in the
meantime, hopefully other types of users can also gain something from
this article.</em></p>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console" class="external-link">Google
Cloud console</a> and sign in:</p>
<p><a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/" class="external-link uri">https://console.cloud.google.com/</a></p>
<p><img src="img/google-cloud-platform-sign-in.png" alt='The sign in page for Google Cloud Platform. The "Email or phone" box is selected and ready for user input. In the lower left is a "Next" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Since this is your first usage of Google Cloud, you need to agree to
their Terms of Service.</p>
<p><img src="img/google-cloud-welcome-new-user.png" alt="A screen with a checkbox to agree to the Google Cloud terms of service." width="600px"></p>
<p>At this point, you might see an offer to start a free trial of Google
Cloud Platform, but that is not necessary in order to create an OAuth
client. You might be interested in the free trial if you want to
experiment with Google Cloud services that normally cost money, such as
BigQuery or Maps. You can activate the free trial, now, later, or never;
it has nothing to do with your ability to create an OAuth client that
works with gmailr.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="create-a-google-cloud-project">Create a Google Cloud project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-a-google-cloud-project"></a>
</h2>
<p>Next we need to select a project. Locate and click the “Select a
project” button.</p>
<p><img src="img/select-a-project-new-user-1.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at the "Select a project" button, which is in the upper left, next to "Google Cloud".' width="600px"></p>
<p>Since you are a new user, presumably you don’t have any existing
projects. Click “NEW PROJECT” in the upper right corner. It is fine to
see “No organization” here; that’s expected if the Google account you’re
using exists outside of Google Workspace.</p>
<p><img src="img/select-a-project-new-user-2.png" alt='The "Select a project" with an arrow pointing to the "NEW PROJECT" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Now you are on the “New Project” screen.</p>
<p><img src="img/new-project-new-user.png" alt='The "New Project" screen with a box where the user enters the Project name and a "CREATE" button. There are arrows pointing at this box, this button, and the Project ID.' width="600px"></p>
<p>I strongly recommend that you <strong>do not</strong> accept the
automatically generated project name. Instead I recommend that you give
the project some meaningful (or at least memorable) label that reminds
you of its purpose and use that for both the project name and project
ID. When you are happy with the project name and ID, click the “CREATE”
button. In this example, we are using “gmailr-fun” as the project name
(and ID).</p>
<p>Now you should see that you are working within your intended target
project.</p>
<p><img src="img/select-a-project-new-user-3.png" alt='The button that previously said "Select a project" for a new user now says "gmailr-fun", which is the name of the target project.' width="600px"></p>
<!--
An existing Google Cloud user will land on a page similar to one of those shown here.
**The important thing is to confirm that the selected project (the project in which you want to create the OAuth client) is selected.**
The areas indicated by orange arrows are where you will see information about the currently selected project.

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="enable-the-gmail-api-for-the-project">Enable the Gmail API for the project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#enable-the-gmail-api-for-the-project"></a>
</h2>
<p>Now we configure APIs &amp; Services for this project. There are
various ways to get to this screen, depending on where you start and the
type of Google account. Hopefully you can find your way to something
like this:</p>
<!--
<div class="figure">
<img src="/home/runner/work/gmailr/gmailr/vignettes/articles/img/apis-and-services-1.png" alt="alt" width="600px" />
<p class="caption">caption
</p>
</div>
-->
<p><img src="img/apis-and-services-2.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at "APIs &amp; Services" in a left sidebar.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Click on “APIs &amp; Services” and then on “Enabled APIs &amp;
services”. Don’t be surprised if some APIs are already enabled, even in
a new project; this happens by default. If this page reveals that the
Gmail API is already enabled, you can move on (that won’t be true in a
new project, but could be true for an existing project). Here’s how this
screen might look for a new project:</p>
<p><img src="img/apis-and-services-3.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrows pointing at the "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Click on “+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES”. In the next screen, search for
the Gmail API and select it. You will get to a screen like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/enable-gmail-api.png" alt='Screen for the Gmail API with an arrow pointing at the "ENABLE" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Click “ENABLE”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="configure-the-oauth-consent-screen">Configure the OAuth consent screen<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#configure-the-oauth-consent-screen"></a>
</h2>
<p>This step may feel unexpected, because you may not be very sure what
the “OAuth consent screen” even is. It can help to connect your goals
with how Google frames this task. Google’s vocabulary in this step
frequently refers to your <em>application</em> or your <em>app</em>. You
can basically think of your Google Cloud project as what Google means by
your app or application. And that project/app basically refers to “the
work I plan to do with the Gmail API from R”.</p>
<p>It’s time to go to “OAuth consent screen”, which is one of the pages
you can access from APIs &amp; Services. Click on “OAuth consent
screen”.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-consent-screen.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at "OAuth consent screen" within "APIs &amp; Services" in a left sidebar.' width="600px"></p>
<p>It is quite difficult to have an OAuth “app” that works for just
anyone. There is an onerous registration and verification process. The
tidyverse team has done this for the Drive, Sheets, and BigQuery APIs,
which makes auth easier for casual R use with the googledrive,
googlesheets4, and bigrquery packages. But it is essentially impossible
to do the same for a project that has the Gmail API enabled. This is why
gmailr users have to create their own OAuth client. Users of
googledrive, googlesheets4, and bigrquery packages may elect to use
their own OAuth client, obtained with the same process described here,
except with different APIs enabled for the project.</p>
<p>Since you and your project are not part of a Google Workspace, you
must choose the “External” user type. This may seem weird, but since you
are not part of an organization, there is no such thing as an internal
user. Select the “External” user type, then click “CREATE”.</p>
<p><img src="img/create-external-oauth-consent-screen.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at a filled radio button indicating the "External" user type and an arrow pointing at the "CREATE" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>(This article focuses on the solo user who is in not part of Google
Workspace, but the process has substantial overlap with creating an
OAuth client for use within an Google Workspace organization. In that
context, the “Internal” user type should be available and is probably
the best choice.)</p>
<p>Now we edit the “App information”. For “App name”, a good default is
to use the same label you used as the project name and project ID,
e.g. “gmailr-fun”. A good default for “User support email” is whatever
Google email address you are logged in with.</p>
<p><img src="img/edit-app-registration-1.png" alt='Screenshot with arrows pointing at the boxes where a user enters "App name" and "User support email".' width="600px"></p>
<p>You can leave “App logo” and “App domain” unconfigured. For the
“Developer contact information”, a good default is whatever Google email
address you are logged in with, which we also used for the “User support
email”. All of this setup and terminology makes more sense for those who
really are creating an application for multiple users. It’s weird for
the solo user, but it is what it is.</p>
<p><img src="img/edit-app-registration-2.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at the box where a user enters an email address as "Developer contact information".' width="600px"></p>
<p>Click “SAVE AND CONTINUE”.</p>
<p>Now we add scopes. Click “ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES”.</p>
<p><img src="img/add-or-remove-scopes.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at the "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>First, select these (nonsensitive) scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>".../auth/userinfo.email"</code></li>
<li><code>".../auth/userinfo.profile"</code></li>
<li><code>"openid"</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it easier to tell which user is associated with an OAuth
token downstream. In particular, the gargle package always adds the
<code>".../auth/userinfo.email"</code> scope when obtaining user tokens,
so you definitely want that enabled here.</p>
<p><img src="img/nonsensitive-scopes.png" alt="Screenshot showing three checked checkboxes for 3 scopes." width="600px"></p>
<p>Then, use the “Filter” feature to find the scopes associated with the
Gmail API. You may want to adjust “Rows per page” to a number high
enough to fit all the Gmail scopes on one page (at the time of writing,
there are 14). By default, I recommend selecting all Gmail scopes, for
ease of downstream use. You can always request a token with narrower
scope with a call like <code>gm_auth(scopes = "gmail.readonly")</code>.
But if you don’t select a scope here, that scope will never be available
to you in <code><a href="../reference/gm_auth.html">gm_auth()</a></code>. If you have a specific reason to be
conservative and you know you only plan to do “read only” work, then you
can be extra careful and only enable specific scopes here. When you’re
done selecting scopes, click “UPDATE”.</p>
<p><img src="img/filter-and-select-gmail-scopes.png" alt="Screenshot showing many checked checkboxes for the Gmail API scopes." width="600px"></p>
<p>When you are returned to the “Edit app registration” screen, things
look quite different, thanks to all the scopes you added. It will look
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/edit-app-registration-3.png" alt="Screenshot of the Scopes page listing the many scopes are now added to the app." width="600px"></p>
<p>Scroll down to the bottom and click “SAVE AND CONTINUE”.</p>
<p><img src="img/edit-app-registration-4.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at the "SAVE AND CONTINUE" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Now we will add a test user: YOU! Click on “+ ADD USERS”.</p>
<p>(If you are creating an OAuth client within a Google Workspace and it
is only for internal users, you can skip the steps around adding test
users. This is only relevant to a client that supports external users
and that has “Testing” publishing status.)</p>
<p><img src="img/edit-app-registration-5.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at the "+ ADD USERS" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Enter your email address and click “ADD”.</p>
<p><img src="img/add-users.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Add users" screen with a box where the user has entered their email address, which is obscured by an opaque rectangle. There is an arrow pointing at the "ADD" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>When you are returned to the “Edit app registration” screen, things
look different, thanks to the test user you added. It will look
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/edit-app-registration-6.png" alt='Screenshot that shows 1 user under "User information", where the email address is obscured by an opaque rectangle. THere is an arrow pointing at the "SAVE AND CONTINUE" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Click “SAVE AND CONTINUE”. Now you arrive at a “Summary” screen, that
summarizes what you’ve entered for “OAuth consent screen”, “Scopes”, and
“Test users”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="create-an-oauth-client">Create an OAuth client<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-an-oauth-client"></a>
</h2>
<p>Now we go to the “Credentials” section of “APIs &amp; Services”. You
can get there in various ways, depending on where you start.</p>
<p><img src="img/go-to-credentials-1.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at "Credentials" below "APIs &amp; Services" in a left sidebar.' width="600px"></p>
<p><img src="img/go-to-credentials-2.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at "Credentials" in a menu accessed by clicking on "APIs &amp; Services" in a left sidebar.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Here’s how this screen will look for a new user and new project,
i.e. where there are no credentials yet.</p>
<p><img src="img/no-existing-credentials.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Credentials" page when there are no existing credentials.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Here’s how this screen might look in a project that has existed for a
long time, that has many existing credentials of various types.</p>
<p><img src="img/many-existing-credentials.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Credentials" page showing existing credentials, e.g. a couple of API keys and several OAuth 2.0 Client IDs.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Now we create a new OAuth client. Click on “+ CREATE
CREDENTIALS”.</p>
<p><img src="img/create-credentials-button.png" alt='Screenshot with an arrow pointing at the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>Select “OAuth client ID”.</p>
<p><img src="img/create-credentials-choices.png" alt='Screenshot of the choices presented when creating new credentials. There is an arrow pointing at "OAuth client ID" which is the correct choice, along with the text "YES". Two other choices, "API key" and "Service account", are marked with the text "NO".' width="600px"></p>
<p>Next you must choose “Application type”.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-client-type-choices.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Application type" dropdown menu with arrows pointing at two of the choices, "Web application" and "Desktop app".' width="600px"></p>
<p>Here’s how to choose the application type:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Desktop app: use this if you’re going to use gmailr on your local
computer. More technically, this is appropriate for any setting where
the httpuv R package will be able to spin up a local web server (gargle
does this behind the scenes for you).</p>
<p>The “Desktop app” client type can also be used in a hosted/cloud
context, under very specific circumstances. The GCP project’s OAuth
consent screen must be configured for internal users within a Google
workspace or for external users in “Testing” mode. This is associated
with a conventional or legacy out-of-bound (oob) auth flow.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Web application: use this if you’re going to use gmailr in some
sort of hosted or cloud context, such as RStudio Server, Posit
Workbench, Posit Cloud, or Google Colaboratory, with a GCP project whose
OAuth consent screen is configured for external users with “In
production” publishing status. This is the client type needed for a
gargle-specific variant of oob known as pseudo-oob.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that above, we are talking about the computing environment where
you will do the OAuth dance, i.e. where you will obtain new tokens. If
you are going to do auth on your local computer, then deploy that token
to Posit Connect or Cloud or shinyapps.io, you can still use a “Desktop
app”. (This workflow is detailed in
<code><a href="../articles/deploy-a-token.html">vignette("deploy-a-token")</a></code>.)</p>
<p>Let’s say you choose “Desktop app”. (In a later section, we address
the “Web application” type.) Again, you’ll get a chance to give the
client a name. I encourage you to give it a label that has some meaning
and that you can hold in your head for minutes at a time. In this
example, I use the name “desktop-aardvark”. I incorporate “desktop” to
remind myself which type of client this is and “aardvark” is just a
random animal. If I need to add another client later (maybe of “Web
application” type), I might call that one “web-baboon”. You get the
idea.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-client-create.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Create OAuth client ID" screen with "Desktop app" selected as the Application type and "desktop-aardvark" filled in the "Name" box. There are arrows pointing at the "Name" box and the "CREATE" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>You should see the happy news that your OAuth client was created:</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-client-created-yay.png" alt='Screenshot of the "OAuth client created" pop-up, with a large oval highlighting the "DOWNLOAD JSON" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>We want to “DOWNLOAD JSON”, but rest assured that, as it says: “The
client ID and secret can always be accessed from Credentials in APIs
&amp; Services” (including as downloadable JSON). This is not one of
those screens where you need to panic because you can never access this
information again.</p>
<p>Click “DOWNLOAD JSON” and a <code>.json</code> file will be
downloaded to wherever your browser is configured to put such things.
The filename will look like this (but longer and more random):</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">client_secret_8675309</span><span class="op">-</span><span class="va">nobody4overcome4nuanced.apps.googleusercontent.com</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you’re still looking at the “OAuth client created” pop-up, click
“OK”. Now the “Credentials” screen within “APIs &amp; Services” will
look more like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/one-existing-credential.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Credentials" screen showing 1 existing OAuth 2.0 Client ID named "desktop-aardvark".' width="600px"></p>
<p>You should see your successfully created OAuth client ID, with the
name you gave it.</p>
<p>If you ever need to access to this JSON again, come back to the
“Credentials” screen. Each existing OAuth client ID has a download
button.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-client-post-hoc-download.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Credentials" screen with an arrow pointing at a "download" icon in the table row associated with the existing OAuth 2.0
 Client ID named "desktop-aardvark".' width="600px"></p>

</h2>
<p><code><a href="../reference/gm_auth_configure.html">gm_auth_configure()</a></code> is the function we use to tell
gmailr about this OAuth client. It is best to provide the filepath of
the downloaded JSON to the <code>path</code> argument:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>gm_auth_configure <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(...,</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                              <span class="at">path =</span> <span class="fu">gm_default_oauth_client</span>(),</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                              ...) { ... }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a couple of ways this can work. You can provide an actual
<code>path</code> in your R code. This makes sense in some settings. But
most users should take advantage of the default value of
<code>path</code>, which calls
<code><a href="../reference/gmailr-configuration.html">gm_default_oauth_client()</a></code>.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/gmailr-configuration.html">gm_default_oauth_client()</a></code> knows to look for the JSON in
a few specific locations or environment variables. Unless you have a
reason to do otherwise, you might as well arrange for the OAuth client
JSON to be discovered by <code><a href="../reference/gmailr-configuration.html">gm_default_oauth_client()</a></code>. In
order of preference:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>Move the downloaded JSON file to the location returned by
<code>rappdirs::user_data_dir("gmailr")</code>. You could accomplish
this move with code like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">path_old</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">"~/Downloads/client_secret_123-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com.json"</span></span>
<span><span class="va">d</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">fs</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://fs.r-lib.org/reference/create.html" class="external-link">dir_create</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu">rappdirs</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rappdirs.r-lib.org/reference/user_data_dir.html" class="external-link">user_data_dir</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"gmailr"</span><span class="op">)</span>, recurse <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">fs</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://fs.r-lib.org/reference/file_move.html" class="external-link">file_move</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">path_old</span>, <span class="va">d</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s important that the target folder only has one file whose name
“looks” like a Google OAuth client file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the downloaded JSON file in some other location (perhaps
this is out of your control). Inform gmailr by recording this filepath
in the <code>GMAILR_OAUTH_CLIENT</code> environment variable. In your
<code>.Renviron</code>, you would have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>GMAILR_OAUTH_CLIENT=/path/to/my/gmailr/oauth-client.json</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve successfully made your OAuth client automatically
discoverable, you should be able to call
<code><a href="../reference/gm_auth_configure.html">gm_auth_configure()</a></code> with no arguments, like this, and then
immediately use <code><a href="../reference/gm_auth_configure.html">gm_oauth_client()</a></code> to confirm that a client
has been configured:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://gmailr.r-lib.org">gmailr</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/gm_auth_configure.html">gm_auth_configure</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/gm_auth_configure.html">gm_oauth_client</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; &lt;gargle_oauth_client&gt;</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; name: ...</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; id: ...</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; secret: &lt;REDACTED&gt;</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; type: installed</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; redirect_uris: ...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you should be able to “just use” gmailr, with or without an
explicit call to <code><a href="../reference/gm_auth.html">gm_auth()</a></code>.</p>
<p>Note that you will see some slightly scary screens when using your
own personal OAuth client as one of the test users. Once you do anything
that triggers gmailr auth, you’ll see this:</p>
<p><img src="img/google-hasnt-verified-this-app.png" alt="Screenshot that reads: &quot;Google hasn't verified this app. You've been given access to an app that's currently being tested. You should only continue if you know the developer that invited you.&quot; There is an arrow pointing at the word &quot;Continue&quot;. There is also a button labelled as &quot;Back to safety&quot;." width="600px"></p>
<p>Once you click “Continue”, you’ll need to say exactly what
permissions you are willing to grant:</p>
<p><img src="img/select-what-app-can-access.png" alt='Screenshot that reads: "gmailr-fun wants access to your Google Account". Then it shows the email "jenny.f.bryan@gmail.com". Next the text "Select what gmailr-fun can access". The choice "Associate you with your personal info on Google" is preselected and greyed out, indicating this choice cannot be altered. The choice "See your primary Google Account email address" is preselected and greyed out, indicating this choice cannot be altered. The choice "Read, compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail" has been checked. This is emphasized with an orange oval. Then there is text: "Make sure you trust gmailr-fun. You may be sharing sensitive info with this site or app. You can always see or remove access in your Google Account. There is an arrow pointing at the "Continue" button at the bottom of the page.' width="600px"></p>
<p>The pre-checked items reflect those nonsensitive scopes mentioned
earlier. But you still need to explicitly check the box for “Read,
compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail”. Note
that the exact wording and permissions of this last item may vary, if
you specify non-default <code>scopes</code> in your
<code><a href="../reference/gm_auth.html">gm_auth()</a></code> call. Click “Continue” to obtain a user token
and, hopefully, live out your gmailr-powered dreams of controlling Gmail
from R.</p>
<p>At this point, your GCP project is in “Testing” mode. That has the
potential downside that refresh tokens only last for 1 week, i.e. the
credential can be refreshed automatically for only 1 week. After that,
the refresh token becomes invalid, and you’ll have to re-do the OAuth
dance. There are two ways to get a token that is more persistent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch the publishing status, in your OAuth consent screen settings,
from “Testing” to “In production”. That is explained in the next
section.</li>
<li>Use a GCP project that is within a Google workspace and configure
the OAuth consent screen for the “Internal” user type. This is obviously
only available to folks working within a Google workspace and that
either describes you or it doesn’t.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="use-a-non-verified-in-production-app">Use a non-verified, “In production” app<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-a-non-verified-in-production-app"></a>
</h2>
<p>This section discusses the experience if your GCP project is
<em>not</em> inside a Google workspace, but you have decided to change
its publishing status from “Testing” to “In production”. The reason you
might do this is to get a token that remains valid for more than 1 week.
This can be done in the OAuth consent screen configuration. Click the
“PUBLISH APP” button.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-consent-screen-publishing-status-testing.png" alt='Screenshot of the configuration of the OAuth consent screen. There is an arrow pointing at the "PUBLISH APP" button in the Publishing status section.' width="600px"></p>
<p>You will then see a new pop-up asking you to confirm this choice,
outlining various implications and requirements.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-consent-screen-push-to-production.png" alt='Screenshot of a pop-up explaining the implications of putting an app into production mode, with the option to click "CANCEL" or "CONFIRM". There is an arrow pointing at "CONFIRM".' width="600px"></p>
<p>Presumably you have no intention of doing any of these things, since
this OAuth client is for personal use. Regardless, click “CONFIRM” to
proceed.</p>
<p>Now the OAuth consent screen settings reflect the new publishing
status, which is “In production”. However, you will also see that your
project “Needs verification”. You will just have to accept this
situation as something awkward that comes when an individual R user is
forced to use API configuration that is really designed for application
developers.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-consent-screen-in-production-needs-verification.png" alt='Screenshot of the configuration of the OAuth consent screen. There is an oval highlighting the new "In production" publishing status and another oval highlighting the "Needs verification" status.' width="600px"></p>
<p>You should be able to make personal use of the OAuth client now,
despite the fact that it “Needs verification”. Your GCP project and
OAuth client(s) can exist in this state as long as the usage is
extremely low, in terms of the number of unique users, which presumably
will be 1 or some other very small number. You can learn more about
exceptions to the verification requirements in the <a href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914#restricted-scopes&amp;zippy=%2Cexceptions-to-verification-requirements" class="external-link">Google
OAuth API verification FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>When you do the OAuth dance, you will again see some scary screens,
due to the “Needs verification” flag on the project.</p>
<p><img src="img/google-hasnt-verified-this-app-advanced.png" alt="Screenshot of a pop-up titled &quot;Google hasn't verified this app&quot;. There is an arrow pointing at the &quot;Advanced&quot; button." width="600px"></p>
<p>When you are first informed that “Google hasn’t verified this app”,
click “Advanced” to proceed. You will get a slightly different scary
screen, advising you to continue only if you understand the risks and
trust the developer, i.e. yourself. Click “Go to YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
(unsafe)” to proceed to the usual consent screens.</p>
<p><img src="img/google-hasnt-verified-this-app-go-to-unsafe.png" alt="Screenshot of a pop-up titled &quot;Google hasn't verified this app&quot;. There is an arrow pointing at the &quot;Go to YOUR-PROJECT-NAME (unsafe)&quot; button." width="600px"></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="create-an-oauth-client-of-web-application-type">Create an OAuth client of “Web application” type<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-an-oauth-client-of-web-application-type"></a>
</h2>
<p>This section adds a few details about creating an OAuth client of
“Web application” type, as opposed to “Desktop app” type. You will do
this if you’re going to obtain tokens, i.e. go through the OAuth dance,
when both of these are true:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>R is running in a web browser. Examples include RStudio Server,
Posit Workbench, Posit Cloud, or Google Colaboratory.</li>
<li>The OAuth consent screen for the GCP project that owns the OAuth
client specifies the “External” user type and has publishing status “In
production” (as opposed to “Testing”). This is associated with a
gargle-specific variant of the “out-of-bound” (oob) auth flow known as
pseudo-oob.</li>
</ol>
<p>The oob auth flows are described in the gargle article <a href="https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/auth-from-web.html" class="external-link">Auth when
using R from the browser</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s pick up the instruction above at the point where you are
choosing an “Application type”. This time we choose “Web
application”.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-client-type-choices.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Application type" dropdown menu with arrows pointing at two of the choices, "Web application" and "Desktop app".' width="600px"></p>
<p>You’ll get a chance to give the client a name. I encourage you to
give it a label that has some meaning and that you can hold in your head
for minutes at a time. In this example, I use the name “web-baboon”. I
incorporate “web” to remind myself which type of client this is and
“baboon” is just a random animal.</p>
<p><img src="img/oauth-client-create-web-application.png" alt='Screenshot of the "Create OAuth client ID" screen with "Web application" selected as the Application type and "web-baboon" filled in the "Name" box. There are arrows pointing at the "Name" box and the "CREATE" button.' width="600px"></p>
<p>You can leave “Authorized JavaScript origins” unconfigured.</p>
<p>However, for the pseudo-oob flow, you <strong>must</strong> configure
a URI in the “Authorized redirect URIs” section. This should be a web
page capable of handling a successful response from Google’s
authorization server. The page should take that response and expose a
code that the user can copy and paste back into R. The gargle package
then processes that input and extracts an authorization code needed to
complete the auth process. Tidyverse packages use
<code>https://www.tidyverse.org/google-callback/</code> for this
purpose. If you want to host your own page, a suitable HTML file ships
with the gargle package at
<code>system.file("pseudo-oob/google-callback/index.html", package = "gargle")</code>.
In that case, you should configure its associated URL as an “Authorized
redirect URI”.</p>
<p>From this point on, everything about downloading the JSON and
configuring the OAuth client is the same as before.</p>
