## Current state

gmailr is stable and does not have much active development or issues submitted.

## Known outstanding issues

It is possible we should verify the setup instructinos are still accurate and maybe expand them if needed https://gmailr.r-lib.org/articles/gmailr.html#external-setup, https://github.com/r-lib/gmailr/issues/143

Maybe write some more documentation on using gmailr non-interactively 'in production'.

## Future directions

Maybe integrate with blastula in some way? https://github.com/rstudio/blastula

Helper functions around making and then sending groups of drafts might be handy (https://github.com/r-lib/gmailr/issues/158)
